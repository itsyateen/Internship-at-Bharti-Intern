The Titanic Dataset Analysis project delves into one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history â€“ the sinking of the RMS Titanic. This project, undertaken as part of the internship with Bharti Intern, involves a comprehensive examination of the dataset pertaining to the passengers aboard the Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage.

The Titanic dataset serves as a valuable resource for data analysis and exploration, offering insights into the demographics, socioeconomic backgrounds, and survival outcomes of the passengers. This project aims to extract meaningful information from the dataset and uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that shed light on various aspects of the disaster.
